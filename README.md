# A little tool to check vulnerabilities of OSS
## my fist push

- based on JVN iPedia's API
- made by python 3 and many py libraries
- cli style and no GUI
- need parameter file input to launch
- how it works:
   - get names of OSS from the input parameter file
   - access the JVN iPedia's API with the name of OSS one by one
   - collect the response results
   - transfer the results to a csv file
- still working on making it easier to use
- thanks.
